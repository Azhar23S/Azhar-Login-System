# Azhar's Login System

Hi, This is Azhar. 
This is my first project "Azhar's Login System" submitted to Guvi as my first assignment
This is very basic login system written with Python.

This contains "Registeration" which ask Email and password from users and saves it.
The user can "Login" with registered email and password (It'll show error if it is doesn't exists).
The user can also Retrieve the old password or can Generate new password which will replace old password.
